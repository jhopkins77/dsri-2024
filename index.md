## About the author 

Jeffrey Hopkins was an award-winning fire juggler who, when he literally felt burnt out, decided to embark on documenting all human knowledge. He thought it a good idea since no one had previously done it before. Thinking this incredibly stupid, he set to work on correcting the error in the hopes of making others less stupid.
